## How to use

1. Create a `dependencies.json` file in your package root with the following contents:

    ```js
    {
       "*": {
          "*": [
             "pathtools",
             "watchdog"
          ]
       }
    }
    ```

2. Run the **Package Control: Satisfy Dependencies** command via command palette

3. Import as you [usually do](http://pythonhosted.org/watchdog/quickstart.html) in stand-alone Python, e.g.

    ```python
    from watchdog.observers import Observer
    from watchdog.events import FileSystemEventHandler
    ```

4. Make sure to look at [*package_events*](https://github.com/codexns/package_events), if youâ€™re wondering about emitting and listening events.
